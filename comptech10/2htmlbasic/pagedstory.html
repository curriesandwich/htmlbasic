            I woke in the night to a noise from the kitchen,
            <br>
            So off I set out on a fact-finding mission.
            <br><br><br>
            Whatever it was, I did not have a clue.
            <br>
            As I got closer I heard a loud chew.
            <br><br><br>
            The fridge door was open with food on the ground.
            <br>
            A tiny blue penguin was looking around!
            <br><br><br>
            He looked through our food and he tossed it aside.
            <br>
            He opened each can and shook out the inside.
            <br><br><br>
            “Excuse me!” I said, but he seemed not to care.
            <br>
            I shut the fridge door and he shot me a glare.
            <br><br><br>
            “Jelly,” he said as he held up some bread,
            <br>
            With smooth peanut butter, he must have just spread.
            <br><br><br>

        <br>
        “Jelly?” I answered, “I... think we ran out,”
        <br>
        The little blue penguin, now wore a blue pout.
        <br><br><br>
        “Jelly,” he said as he waddled away.
        <br>
        Without any jelly, why would he stay?
        <br><br><br>
        I followed him out through our squeaky backdoor.
        <br>
        An igloo was there, that was not there before.
        <br><br><br>
        He slid on his belly, inside, out of sight.
        <br>
        But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.
        <br><br><br>
        I heard a loud ruckus and ran back to see,
        <br>
        A giant giraffe flipping though my tv.
        <br><br><br>

        He munched on some chips and kept changing the channel
        <br>
        He wore a bathrobe that was made of red flannel.
        <br><br><br>
        “Excuse me!” I yelled but he turned up the sound,
        <br>
        And most of the chips ended up on the ground.
        <br><br><br>
        He tossed up a few and he took a big bite.
        <br>
        But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.
        <br><br><br>
        I heard water splashing the bathroom upstairs,
        <br>
        And found a large octopus bathing in there.
        <br><br><br>
        She had my green shower cap on, just my luck.
        <br>
        I saw she had taken my new rubber duck.
        <br><br><br>
        I said “Finish up!”, and she told me, “All right.”
        <br>
        But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.
        <br><br><br>
        Back in my bedroom, a CRASH and a THUD.
        <br>
        Two lemurs were throwing around balls of mud.
        <br><br><br>
        My room was a mess and they both were to blame.
        <br>
        I swear I had just cleaned it up! What a shame.

        There was mud on the dresser, the desk, and the light.

        But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.

        Outside I looked up, and I know it’s bizarre,
        <br>
        But guess what flew by me? A bright shooting star!
        <br><br><br>
        I wished for the penguin to get all his jelly.
        <br>
        I wished the giraffe would stop using my telly.
        <br><br><br>
        I wished that the octopus there in my tub,
        <br>
        Would exit the bathroom and give it a scrub.
        <br><br><br>
        I wished that my room would somehow become clean.
        <br>
        I wished that this nonsense would all be a dream.
        <br><br><br>
        The lemurs both left. The giraffe had enough.
        <br>
        The octopus gave me back all of my stuff.
        <br><br><br>
        The blue penguin waddled right up to my feet.
        <br>
        He carried a sandwich, most ready to eat.
        <br><br><br>
        Then he flew off when he flapped both his wings
        <br>
        And that, of it all, was the oddest of things...
        <br><br><br>
