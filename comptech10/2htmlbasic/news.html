   <p><b>(CNN) - </b>In March, world trade was thrown into chaos by a boat. The Ever Given, a container ship nearly as long as the Empire State Building is tall, ran aground in the Suez Canal in Egypt. It was stuck for six days, disrupting global supply chains.</p>

   <p>In an effort to avoid a repeat of the event, in mid-May, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced it had started dredging work to widen and deepen the southern part of the canal where the Ever Given was jammed.</p>

   <p>The 30-kilometer-long area will be widened by 40 meters (131 feet) to the east and deepened to 72 feet, up from 66 feet, according to the SCA. Plans also include extending the second lane near the Great Bitter Lake, which opened in 2015, by 10 kilometers (6 miles) -- allowing two-way traffic along an 82 kilometer (51 mile) stretch.</p>

   <h3>Ship size</h3>

   <p>Over the past 50 years the container carrying capacity of the biggest ships has increased by 1,500%, and doubled over the past decade alone, according to shipping insurer Allianz Global Corporate and Speciality.</p>

   <p>The largest ships can carry up to 24,000 containers and measure over 200 feet at their widest point -- wider than a standard American football field. The Ever Given -- which can hold up to 20,000 containers but was only carrying 18,000 at the time of grounding -- is in the top 1% globally in terms of vessel size, measuring 400 meters (1,312 feet) long and 59 meters (194 feet) wide.</p>

   <br>
   <h3>Future routes</h3>

   <p>However, the Ever Given incident did prompt discussion of alternative routes. The canal's strategic position -- connecting the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and offering the shortest sea route between Europe and Asia -- is key to its influence.</p>

   <p>Without the Suez, shipments between the two continents would have to travel around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. Some shipping companies opted for this route while the Suez was blocked, despite it taking more than double the time.</p>
