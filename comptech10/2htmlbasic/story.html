            I woke in the night to a noise from the kitchen,
            <br>
            So off I set out on a fact-finding mission.
            <br><br><br>
            Whatever it was, I did not have a clue.
            <br>
            As I got closer I heard a loud chew.
            <br><br><br>
            The fridge door was open with food on the ground.
            <br>
            A tiny blue penguin was looking around!
            <br><br><br>
            He looked through our food and he tossed it aside.
            <br>
            He opened each can and shook out the inside.
            <br><br><br>
            “Excuse me!” I said, but he seemed not to care.
            <br>
            I shut the fridge door and he shot me a glare.
            <br><br><br>
            “Jelly,” he said as he held up some bread,
            <br>
            With smooth peanut butter, he must have just spread.
            <br><br><br>

            <br>
            “Jelly?” I answered, “I... think we ran out,”
            <br>
            The little blue penguin, now wore a blue pout.
            <br><br><br>
            “Jelly,” he said as he waddled away.
            <br>
            Without any jelly, why would he stay?
            <br><br><br>
            I followed him out through our squeaky backdoor.
            <br>
            An igloo was there, that was not there before.
            <br><br><br>
            He slid on his belly, inside, out of sight.
            <br>
            But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.
            <br><br><br>
            I heard a loud ruckus and ran back to see,
            <br>
            A giant giraffe flipping though my tv.
            <br><br><br>

            He munched on some chips and kept changing the channel
            <br>
            He wore a bathrobe that was made of red flannel.
            <br><br><br>
            “Excuse me!” I yelled but he turned up the sound,
            <br>
            And most of the chips ended up on the ground.
            <br><br><br>
            He tossed up a few and he took a big bite.
            <br>
            But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.
            <br><br><br>
            I heard water splashing the bathroom upstairs,
            <br>
            And found a large octopus bathing in there.
            <br><br><br>
            She had my green shower cap on, just my luck.
            <br>
            I saw she had taken my new rubber duck.
            <br><br><br>
            I said “Finish up!”, and she told me, “All right.”
            <br>
            But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.
            <br><br><br>
            Back in my bedroom, a CRASH and a THUD.
            <br>
            Two lemurs were throwing around balls of mud.
            <br><br><br>
            My room was a mess and they both were to blame.
            <br>
            I swear I had just cleaned it up! What a shame.
            <br><br><br>

            There was mud on the dresser, the desk, and the light.

            But, it wasn’t the oddest thing I saw that night.

            Outside I looked up, and I know it’s bizarre,
            <br>
            But guess what flew by me? A bright shooting star!
            <br><br><br>
            I wished for the penguin to get all his jelly.
            <br>
            I wished the giraffe would stop using my telly.
            <br><br><br>
            I wished that the octopus there in my tub,
            <br>
            Would exit the bathroom and give it a scrub.
            <br><br><br>
            I wished that my room would somehow become clean.
            <br>
            I wished that this nonsense would all be a dream.
            <br><br><br>
            The lemurs both left. The giraffe had enough.
            <br>
            The octopus gave me back all of my stuff.
            <br><br><br>
            The blue penguin waddled right up to my feet.
            <br>
            He carried a sandwich, most ready to eat.
            <br><br><br>
            Then he flew off when he flapped both his wings
            <br>
            And that, of it all, was the oddest of things...
            <br><br><br>
